Workplan for MNXB01 final project.

Chris will do the "Temperature of a given day" part of section 3.1 in the manual. 


Philip will do the "warmest and coldest day of the year" part in Section 3.3 in the
manual and try to find a way to plot a histogram for the length of summer in number of days (by
the meteorlogical definition of a certain number of days above/below a given temperature).
In order to do this will I first try to creata class which reads in data file and stores the data in a vector
with a subvector for each year. Each vector for a given year will then contain a sub vector for each month,
and each month subvector will contain subvectors for each day/mean temperature for the day in some way.

I will then try to make some functions to calculate the warmest/coldest day of each year and then plot that in a
histogram. To do the other project I will try to make a function that finds the start and end of a time interval
where the mean temperature is above some limit and then use that to make the necessary plots.
